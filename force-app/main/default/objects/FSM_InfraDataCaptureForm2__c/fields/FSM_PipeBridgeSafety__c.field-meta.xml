    <inlineHelpText>Signage should be installed on all pipe bridges. 	
There may be a few exceptions where it is physically not possible or safe to install but where this is the case often signs can be installed nearby giving the same warning. 	
Signs are available from H&amp;S Reps and should be taken on site inspections in case signs need replacing. 	
If it is not safe to install but required raise to supervisor for advice on how to do safely.</inlineHelpText>
