        <!-- Fencing may be installed on some pipe bridges. 	
The need for fencing will need to be assessed based on the risk but will be generally where the consequence is high i.e. rail crossings / high fall and likelihood is sufficient. 	
Fencing comes in different styles and palisade fencing is most secure with post and rail less secure and can be climbed. 	
Fencing may require planning permission and land agreements. -->
